Presenting Data Stories with Jupyter

Brief description:
Exploring the famous Iris dataset. Our goal is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data and present them in an engaging manner.

Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset contains information about three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. It includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Let's start by taking a quick look at the structure of the data.

# Steps Performed

1. I created the github with the name datafun-04-jupyter and added the file READ.ME
2. Created the folder in finder (datafun-04-jupyter) in the parent folder documents>NWMO
3. Copied the URL from github with the new repository name (datafun-04-jupyter)
4. I opened VS code and did open file and went to documents>NWMO>datafun-04-jupyter
5. Open new terminal and did: git clone datafun-04-jupyter
6. I created Create a Project Virtual Environment in VS code typed: python3 -m venv .venv
7. Activate Project Virtual Environment in VS typed: source .venv/bin/activate
8. in vs code, went to file>new file and created a requirements.txt
9. packages were installed: python3 -m pip install requests
10. requirements.txt was installed: pip install -r requirements.txt
11. freezed requirements: python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
12. verified the following were installed in the folder in finder (making sure the hiding folder are showin)
venv/, .gitignore, README.md and requirements.txt
13. performed git add and commited initial changes with a message: 
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
14. performed gitpush to github: git push origin main
15. confirmed in github that the changes are showinf as "commit"
